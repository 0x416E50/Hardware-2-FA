To add a tag, connect a micro USB cable to the Raspberry Pi Pico. Open Thonny IDE, and open main.py. There, in line numebr 27, edit the function **def_RFID_tag**.
It's a dictionary, that is responsible to store all the registered tags, their Pins, and the respective GPIO pin that triggers the relay. 
Add the tag, following the order

        def validate_rfid_tag(uid):
                  users = {
                      <uid>: ('User1', <Pin>, <GPIO Pin>)
                  }
